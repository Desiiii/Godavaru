# Godavaru
This is the official repository for the Godavaru Discord bot. The main developer is
[@Desiiii](https://github.com/Desiiii) (Desiree üå∫#0611). Below you will find a list of features that come with
this bot. As this was last updated (24/05/2018), Godavaru is in version **2.2.1**. Note that if the version
number is followed by **ALPHA** or **BETA**, it is only available via the Development instance, not on the public
instance.
```
Action Commands
  -> hug, kiss, even some lewd ones! (usable only in NSFW channels of course)
Moderation Commands
  -> Ban, kick, prune, and more!
Utility Commands
  -> Urban dictionary search, dictionary search, complex mathematics, and much more!
Fun Commands
  -> Slots, trivia, bowling, and other miscellaneous features to keep you occupied!
Informational Commands
  -> User ID lookup, discriminator lookup, role information, and more!
```
For a full list of all commands, use `g_help` in any guild that the bot is in.

# Avatar
For anyone who may be curious, Godavaru is not an actual character in any anime. The avatar is actually Yayoi from KanColle, in case you were curious as of who the character is.

Why use a different name? Why not make my own avatar? Quite simply, I like the images of Yayoi and I am a terrible artist. :\<

# Developers
The following is a list of developers of the Godavaru bot.

# Running the bot
Running the bot is not recommended and while it may be quite simple to do, you will not receive support on
obtaining API keys, filling in config files, or anything else. This bot is mostly here as a reference to see how
I do things, which even so is not the most effective way of doing things.

# Inqueries
If you'd like to contact me about working together on the bot or some other inquery, contact me via my business
email at: `godavaru@gmail.com`. Alternatively, you may message me on Discord. My tag is Desiree üå∫#0611 and my ID
is 267207628965281792. I may not respond at first, but I will almost always see it. üëç

# Thanks ya!
Thanks for using the Godavaru bot! It means a lot to see my own personal creation being used in over **400**
servers!
