# Godavaru
This is the official GitHub for the Godavaru bot, made by `Desiree#3658` in Python.
The bot may become a good bot one day, but at the moment, it's a beginner project, primarily for me to learn Python. Hope you enjoy it so far!

You can contact me on Twitter, `@Diallusions` or Discord, `Desiree#3658` or join the support guild [here.]( https://discord.gg/ewvvKHM) 

Get updates on github instantly in the #github channel on my support guild!

# Developers
Our current developers are @Desiiii, @instanceofplayer, @Yuvira, and @jonasbpa. Contact them with any questions/concerns!

# Utilities
This bot provieds mostly fun commands, but moderation commands are in the works. If you would like to suggest anything, feel free to do so using `g_request <suggestion>` and it will be sent straight to myself and the other developers.

# Running the bot
I do not recommend downloading and running the bot yourself. While it is not a very big bot in file size, it does require the images file, which would take ages for me to upload here to github. If you wish to supply your own images and gifs for the action commands, feel free to download the repository and in main.py, replace `'token'` with your bot's token, replace the command prefix with whatever you want, and you should be good to go. As stated before, this is not recommended, but if you wanted to know, there it is

# Inqueries
If you'd like to contact me about working together on the bot or some other inquery, contact me via my business email at: `godavaru@gmail.com`

# Thanks ya!
Thank you for using Godavaru bot, it really means a lot to me! I know it's just a starter project, but with the fact that we just hit 100 guilds, I definitely won't stop developing it. Thanks again!
