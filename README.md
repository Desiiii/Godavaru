# Godavaru
This is the offical repository for the Godavaru discord bot, made and devloped by Desiree#3658. This is a bot that is made with the idea of making your discord experience smoother, more interesting, and overall fun. With this, the bot has: 
```
Action Commands
  -> hug, kiss, even some lewd ones! (usable only in NSFW channels of course)
Moderation Commands
  -> Ban, kick, prune, and more!
Utility Commands
  -> Urban dictionary search, dictionary search, complex mathematics, and much more!
Fun Commands
  -> Slots, trivia, bowling, and other miscellanious features to keep you occupied!
Informational Commands
  -> User ID lookup, discriminator lookup, role information, and more!
```

# Utilities
The bot provides you with fun commands, moderation, and more. For a list of all commands, you may use `g_help`, and for extended help, `g_help <command>` without the brackets.

# Running the bot
Running the bot is not recommended and while it may be quite simple to do, you will not recieve support on recieving API keys, filling in config files, or anything else. This bot is mostly here as a reference to see how I do things, which even so is not the most effective way of doing things.

# Inqueries
If you'd like to contact me about working together on the bot or some other inquery, contact me via my business email at: `godavaru@gmail.com`

# Thanks ya!
